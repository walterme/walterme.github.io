                   <p>Hello my name is walter. Im a quiet person and like being around my friends.
                   My favorite subject is to be History and science I really like learning about the past and 
                   how it contributes to the present day in History. For science I like
                   the fact that you can learn about everything around you and how it works!
                   My hobbies are drawing, playing instruments, playing sports, and I love to hear 
                   music. </p>
